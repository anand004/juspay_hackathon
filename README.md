# Juspay Hackathon

# Problem Statement

Segment 1: Rotating Cube wireframe: Draw a 3D Cube wireframe and rotate it along all the 3 axes that pass through its center at a constant speed. 

Segment 2: Rotating Cube wireframe: The rotating object should decelerate at a rate of ‘X’ degrees/sec^2 before it comes to a standstill.

The object should respond as follows to the following user inputs

Swipe/Drag : Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity
between rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.

Touch/Click : generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)
